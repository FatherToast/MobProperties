1.0.0
    - New conditional checks - in_biome_type_X, biome_temp_X, biome_height_below_X, is_humid, rainfall_above_X, temp_above_X, biome_temp_above_X.
    - New drops-only conditional checks - damage_type_X, killed_with_fire, killed_with_magic, killed_with_projectile, killed_with_indirect, killed_with_explosion,
        killed_with_unblockable, killer_on_ground, killer_burning, killer_wet, killer_submerged, killer_has_potion_X, check_killer_nbt_X, killer_wither_skeleton.
    - The "in_biome" conditional check now uses the biome name instead of numerical id (will warn and give the proper name if you use a numerical id).
0.4.3
    - Added "Info Wand" (get it using /mpinfo <player>) - turns in-game (tile)entity nbt data to an external nbt function.
    - New nbt function - "delete".
    - Dimension check now uses a different method, if possible (fixes bug affecting some).
0.4.2 - "What do you get if you multiply six by nine?"
    - Fixed bug preventing tile entities and entities from being properly placed in the world by schematics.
    - Added tip to look down when a JSON language error occurs.
    - Fixed crash report for missing "function" field in functions.
0.4.1
    - Compressed schematic files can now be read (probably the majority of schematics you will encounter).
    - The "command" function used within stats' "drops" function now executes on the mob's death instead of spawn.
0.4.0
    - The conditional check check_nbt_X can now compare string equality.
    - Stats and pre_stats functions can now be executed from nbt data saved on the mob.
    - Entities with their health set to 0 in pre_stats now have their spawn completely canceled.
    - Fixed possible error in reading block ids.
    - Now provides the string id in the warning log when a numerical id is used, assuming the numerical id is valid.
    - The "potion" function now uses potion names (localization codes) in its "id" field. Numerical ids will log warnings.
    - The "enchant" function now uses enchantment names (localization codes) in its "id" field. Numerical ids will log warnings.
    - New drops/stats function - "command".
    - New drops function - "schematic".
    - New nbt functions - "item_id", "potion_id", "enchant_id".
    - New conditional checks - can_see_sky, on_ground, submerged.
0.3.5
    - Added some additional detail to certain errors.
    - Added an API to allow NER to collect and read modified drops.
0.3.4
    - Fixed "xp" function's "set" operation to now properly set base xp.
    - Default file generation now supports mods with weird mod ids.
0.3.3
    - Fixed crash caused when a mob does not have a MobProperties file.
0.3.2
    - Added "pre_stats" as an actual allowed field. Whoops!
0.3.1
    - Fixed position bug with the "spawn" function when using tags.
    - Default for "set_block" update is now 3 instead of 2.
0.3.0
    - Drops functions called in stats are now themselves saved and executed on death.
      - Old individual item and entity lists will still be dropped/spawned, but no longer created.
      - This means ALL drops functions can now be used exactly as if they were in the drops section.
    - The nbt function "compound" now only overrides the tags defined in the function, instead of the entire compound.
    - New life cycle event - "pre_stats".
    - New universal function - "external".
    - New drops function - "set_block".
    - New nbt function - "chest_loot".
    - New conditional checks - check_nbt_X, above_looting_X, raining, thundering, moon_phase_X, beyond_X, past_world_difficulty_X, player_online_X.
0.2.1
    - Reimplemented MobProperties.json (the main default property file).
    - Now will print warnings when using numerical item/block ids (should still work for now, though).
    - Now accepts peaceful/easy/normal/hard in addition to the numerical difficulty ids for difficulty_X conditional.
0.2
    - Uses a new verification system!
      - Makes sure you are defining all required fields.
      - Makes sure you are only using valid fields or "_comment".
    - Made more fields required (some optional fields had defaults that made the entire function do nothing).
    - New conditional checks - difficulty_X, in_biome_X, on_block_X, past_day_time_X, past_world_time_X.
0.1
    - Bumped up to beta.
    - Mob property files are now parsed in JSON format!
    - Mob id is no longer based on the file name (compatibility fix).

    - Item drops can now be modified by a mob's stats.
      - All drops functions can now be called in the stats function "drops", except "default".
    - New conditional checks - burning, wet, wither_skeleton, in_dimension_X, below_X, has_potion_X, and killed_by_X.
    - Potions can now be applied to potion-immune mobs and/or marked as ambient ("override", "ambient").
    - Mobs' base attributes can now be set using the "modifier" function's new "override" field.
    - New stats functions - "drops", "nbt".
    - New drops functions - "spawn", "xp".
    - MobProperties.mob/json was removed temporarily.
    - Probably some other stuff I forgot.
